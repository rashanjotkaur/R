# Assignment: Assessment of Vectors, Sorting

## Q1: Which of the following lines of code will successfully define vector x?  
   A. x = c(1,5,6)  
   B. x <- 3,"b",8  
   C. x <- c(4,"seven",9)  
   D. x = "z"

## Q2: We have  assigned the temperatures as numeric values to temp and the city names as character values to city. Associate the temperature to its related city.   
    cost <- c(50, 75, 90, 100, 150)  
    food <- c("pizza", "burgers", "salads", "cheese", "pasta")  
    names(cost) <- food

## Q3a:
   How many rows are in the dataset named movielens (inbuilt)?

## Q3b:
   How many different variables are in the dataset named movielens (inbuilt)?

## Q3c:
   What is the variable type of title in the dataset named movielens (inbuilt)?  
   A. It is a text (txt) variable  
   B. It is a chronological (chr) variable  
   C. It is a string (str) variable  
   D. It is a numeric (num) variable  
   E. It is an integer (int) variable  
   F. It is a factor (Factor) variable  
   G. It is a character (chr) variable

## Q3d:
   What is the variable type of genres in the dataset named movielens (inbuilt)? 
   A. It is a text (txt) variable   
   B. It is a chronological (chr) variable  
   C. It is a string (str) variable  
   D. It is a numeric (num) variable  
   E. It is an integer (int) variable  
   F. It is a factor (Factor) variable  
   G. It is a character (chr) variable

## Q4:   
   We already know we can use the levels() function to determine the levels of a factor. A different function, nlevels(), may be used to determine the number of levels of a factor.
   Use this function to determine how many levels are in the factor genres in the movielens data frame.
