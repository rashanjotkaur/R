## Q1: Which of the following lines of code will successfully define vector x?  
    A. x = c(1,5,6)  
    B. x <- 3,"b",8  
    C. x <- c(4,"seven",9)  
    D. x = "z"

## Q2: We have  assigned the temperatures as numeric values to temp and the city names as character values to city. Associate the temperature to its related city.   
    cost <- c(50, 75, 90, 100, 150)  
    food <- c("pizza", "burgers", "salads", "cheese", "pasta")  
    names(cost) <- food
