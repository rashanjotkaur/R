# Assignment: Assessment of R Basics, Functions and Data Types

## Q1:
   What are the two solutions to 2x^2-x-4=0 ? Use the quadratic equation.

## Q2:
   Use R to compute log base 4 of 1024. You can use the help() function to learn how to use arguments to change the base of the log() function.

## Q3a:
   How many rows are in the dataset?

## Q3b:
   How many different variables are in the dataset?

## Q3c:
   What is the variable type of title ?  
   A. It is a text (txt) variable  
   B. It is a chronological (chr) variable  
   C. It is a string (str) variable  
   D. It is a numeric (num) variable  
   E. It is an integer (int) variable  
   F. It is a factor (Factor) variable  
   G. It is a character (chr) variable

## Q3d:
   What is the variable type of genres ?  
   A. It is a text (txt) variable   
   B. It is a chronological (chr) variable  
   C. It is a string (str) variable  
   D. It is a numeric (num) variable  
   E. It is an integer (int) variable  
   F. It is a factor (Factor) variable  
   G. It is a character (chr) variable

## Q4:   
   We already know we can use the levels() function to determine the levels of a factor. A different function, nlevels(), may be used to determine the number of levels of a factor.
   Use this function to determine how many levels are in the factor genres in the movielens data frame.
