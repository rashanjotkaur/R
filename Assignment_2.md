# Assignment: R Basics  

### Q1. What is the sum of the first 100 positive integers?  

### Q2. What is the sum of the integers from 1 through 1,000? 

### Q3. Look at the result of typing the following code into R:  
    n <- 1000  
    x <- seq(1, n)  
    sum(x)  
    Based on the result, what do you think the functions seq and sum do? You can use help.  
    A. sum creates a list of numbers and seq adds them up.  
    B. seq creates a list of numbers and sum adds them up.  
    C. seq creates a random list and sum computes the sum of 1 through 1,000.  
    D. sum always returns the same number.
    
### Q4. In math and programming, we say that we evaluate a function when we replace the argument with a given number. So if we type sqrt(4), we evaluate the sqrt function. In R, you can evaluate a function inside another function. The evaluations happen from the inside out. Use one line of code to compute the log, in base 10, of the square root of 100.  

### Q5. Which of the following will always return the numeric value stored in x? You can try out examples and use the help system if you want.  
    A. log(10^x)  
    B. log10(x^10)  
    C. log(exp(x))  
    D. exp(log(x, base = 2))
