# Section 2 Assessment 

### Question 1
    Consider the vector x:
      x <- c(2, 43, 27, 96, 18)
    Match the following outputs to the function which produces that output. Options include sort(x), order(x), rank(x) and none of these.
    A. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    B. 1, 5, 3, 2, 4
    C. 1, 4, 3, 5, 2  
    D. 2, 18, 27, 43, 96

### Question 2
    Continue working with the vector x defined in question 1. Match the following functions to their output. Options include integers 1 through 5 and none of these.
    A. min(x)
    B. which.min(x)
    C. max(x)
    D. which.max(x)

### Question 3
    Mandi, Amy, Nicole, and Olivia all ran different distances in different time intervals. Their distances (in miles) and times (in minutes) are as follows:
      name <- c("Mandi", "Amy", "Nicole", "Olivia")
      distance <- c(0.8, 3.1, 2.8, 4.0)
      time <- c(10, 30, 40, 50)  
    Write a line of code to convert time to hours. Remember there are 60 minutes in an hour. Then write a line of code to calculate the speed of each runner in miles per hour. Speed is distance divided by time.
    A. How many hours did Olivia run?
    B. What was Mandi's speed in miles per hour?
    C. Which runner had the fastest speed?
